<?php echo S2MEMBER_CURRENT_USER_PAID_REGISTRATION_DAYS; ?>
This may output something like: 120 (120 days is approx 4 months)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, the longer they've been a "paying" Member, the more they get.

<?php if(S2MEMBER_CURRENT_USER_PAID_REGISTRATION_DAYS >= 30){ ?>
	Drip content to Members that started paying you at least 30 days ago.
<?php } ?>

<?php if(S2MEMBER_CURRENT_USER_PAID_REGISTRATION_DAYS >= 60){ ?>
	Drip content to Members that started paying you at least 60 days ago.
<?php } ?>

<?php if(S2MEMBER_CURRENT_USER_PAID_REGISTRATION_DAYS >= 90){ ?>
	Drip content to Members that started paying you at least 90 days ago.
<?php } ?>
