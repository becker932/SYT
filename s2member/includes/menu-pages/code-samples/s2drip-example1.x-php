**NOTE** The use of [s2Drip] requires s2Member Pro.

**NOTE** [s2Drip] will NOT work as expected when testing against an Administrator who is logged in.
	While Administrators DO gain full access to all content, Administrators generally
	do NOT have a paid registration time; i.e. they are not an actual customer.
	Thus, do NOT test this as an Administrator, you WILL be confused :-)
	Administrators will always see the content, no matter.
