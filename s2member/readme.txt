If you're serious about membership management in WordPress, you want s2Member! s2Member supports custom Pages for registration (including Custom Registration/Profile Fields), account access, and a whole lot more. s2Member is compatible with Multisite Networking too, and even with BuddyPress and bbPress.

With the s2Member® Pro add-on (an optional paid upgrade), you can add support for unlimited Membership Levels, Stripe™ (w/ Pro Forms to facilitate on-site credit card processing), PayPal® Website Payments Pro (also with Pro Forms), Authorize.Net® (also with Pro Forms), Google® Checkout, ClickBank®, advanced User Import/Export tools, the ability to use Coupon Codes, and many other enhancements. Videos available at: [s2Member.com / Videos](http://www.s2member.com/videos/).

s2Member supports Free Subscribers (at Level #0), and up to four primary Membership Levels [1-4] (unlimited with s2Member® Pro). You can label your Membership Levels anything you like. The defaults are Free, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. s2Member also supports an unlimited number of Custom Capability Packages. Custom Capabilities are an easy way to extend s2Member in creative ways. Custom Capabilities allow you to create an unlimited number of Membership Packages, all with different Capabilities and prices.

s2Member allows you to protect Pages, Posts, Tags, Categories, URIs, URI word fragments, URI Replacement Codes for BuddyPress, Specific Post/Page "Buy Now" Access, and even portions of content within Posts/Pages/themes/plugins. All settings are configurable through the s2Member Options panel. This makes s2Member VERY easy to integrate into any site powered by WordPress®.

With s2Member, you can also protect downloadable files, using restrictions to control how many downloads can occur within a certain amount of time; all based on Membership Level or even Custom Capabilities. sMember® can even integrate with Amazon® S3 and CloudFront (optional) for serving protected audio/video streams over an RTMP protocol.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= v140816 =

(Maintenance Release) Upgrade immediately.

== Changelog ==

= v140816 =

* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **bbPress Forum Compatibility** Woohoo! This release of s2Member improves s2Member's compatibility with bbPress Forums/Topics/Replies. It is now possible to protect a Forum with s2Member, and have all Topics within that Forum protected automatically. No changes necessary to enable this feature. If you protect a bbPress Forum, this is how s2Member will behave automatically. It's a parent/child relationship that s2Member is now compatible with.

  *WARNING: If you have been running s2Member together with bbPress in the past, this change may impact you. Any bbPress Forums that are protected by s2Member will now also protect all Topics within that Forum. This improvement also impacts s2Member's Alt. View Restrictions. If you are using s2Member's Alt. View Restrictions, any bbPress Topics that live within a protected Forum will automatically be hidden from Alternative Views configured with s2Member.*

  Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/116) if you'd like more info.
* (s2Member Pro) **[s2Stream /] Resolutions** Awesome! This release introduces a new Shortcode Attribute (`player_resolutions=""`).  See [this screenshot](http://bit.ly/1uASNau) of the details and [this screenshot](http://bit.ly/1uASY5M) of the functionality.

  This is an s2Member Pro feature that allows a site owner to offer multiple resolutions of a video through the `[s2Stream /]` Shortcode implemented with s2Member's Download Restrictions. Please see [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/jwplayer-s2stream-shortcodes/#using-s2stream-shortcodes) and choose the **"Shortcode Attributes (Explained)" tab** for all the details, along with an example of `player_resolutions=""` in the `[s2Stream /]` Shortcode.

  See also: [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/179) if you'd like more info.
* (s2Member Pro) **Authorize.Net** This release introduces a new configurable EOT Behavior option for site owners integrated with Authorize.Net. It is now possible to configure a Max Failed Payments threshold; after which s2Member will automatically trigger an EOT (End Of Term). See: `Dashboard ⥱ s2Member ⥱ Authorize.Net Options ⥱ EOT Behavior`. See also: [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/141) if you'd like more info.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Enhancement** A new Replacement Code (`%%current_user_nicename%%`) has been introduced by s2Member to improve compatibility with plugins like BuddyPress and bbPress. If you are currently using a Special Login Redirection URL as your s2Member Login Welcome Page, and you've used `%%current_user_login%%` (i.e. the old way), we suggest that you update your Special Redirection URL to use `%%current_user_nicename%%`. Please see [Jason's comments here](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/276#issuecomment-51706582) for further details. See also: `Dashboard ⥱ s2Member ⥱ General Options ⥱ Login Welcome Page`. It is this area of your Dashboard where a Special Redirection URL can be configured.
* (s2Member Pro) **Pro Login Widget** There are some new Replacement Codes available for the "My Account" page URL, and the "My Profile" page URL whenever you configure the s2Member Pro Login Widget in WordPress. s2Member Pro now supports things like `%%current_user_nicename%%` and `%%current_user_level%%` in these customizable URLs. See: `Dashboard ⥱ Appearance ⥱ Widgets ⥱ s2Member Pro Login Widget` for further details. See also: [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/276#issuecomment-51706582) if you'd like more info.
* (s2Member Pro) **Stripe Bug Fix** Wrapping multiple Stripe Pro Form Shortcodes together as "Checkout Options" was not working properly in the previous release. The dropdown for Checkout Options was not maintaining the underlying variable needed to keep a Checkout Option selected. Fixed in this release. If you'd like more info, please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/296).
* (s2Member Pro) **Stripe Bug Fix** A few site owners reported issues between s2Member's integration with Stripe and other plugins that also depend on the Stripe SDK for PHP. Fixed in this release. If you'd like more info, please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/295).
* (s2Member Pro) **Pro Cancellation Forms** This release introduces a new Shortcode Attribute that can be used with Pro Cancellation Forms. The new Shortcode Attribute is `unsub=""`. Setting this to a value of `unsub="1"` will enable an automatic unsubscribe upon cancellation. To clarify, this is related to any List Servers (e.g. MailChimp, AWeber, GetResponse) that you integrate with s2Member. If `unsub="1"` when a customer cancels future billing they will also be removed from the mailing list they are currently subscribed to, according to your List Server configuration in s2Member. Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/238) if you'd like more info.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Child Theme Compabitility** Portions of s2Member (e.g. Return-Page templates, s2Stream templates, Pro Form templates, IP Restriction templates, and more) allow advanced site owners to use custom templates of their own. In the past these templates *had* to be created inside the parent theme directory or inside of your `/wp-content/` directory. Starting with this release, s2Member will also look for custom templates inside of your current Child Theme directory too (i.e. `get_stylesheet_dir()`). Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/271) if you'd like more info.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **S3/CloudFront Compatibility** The latest release of s2Member has been made compatible with the latest changes at Amazon S3/CloudFront [regarding IAM users](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/updated-iam-console/). If you've been running s2Member together with Amazon S3/CloudFront there are no changes necessary in s2Member configuration. If you are just integrating s2Member with Amazon S3/CloudFront you are advised to setup an IAM user instead of using your AWS Root Keys. s2Member will continue to work with either Root Keys or with IAM user keys. Either are fine. If you'd like more info, please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/297).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **MySQLi Compatiblity** This release brings s2Member into full compatibility with the MySQLi extension. In the previous release it was reported that one specific routine in s2Member that checks the total number of users in your WordPress database was incompatible with MySQLi. Resolved in this release. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/274) if you'd like more info.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Amazon CloudFront** s2Member now makes a new button [Reset CloudFront Configuration] available inside of your WP Dashboard under: `s2Member ⥱ Download Options ⥱ Amazon CloudFront`. This button allows a site owner (if necessary) to do a quick reset of s2Member's current integration with Amazon CloudFront Distributions. Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/270) if you'd like more info.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix** This release corrects a bug in s2Member's log of a user's WordPress Capability access times. This bug had no serious impact on previous releases of s2Member. However, it was a bug that needed fixing nonetheless. Resolved in this release. Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/237) if you'd like more info.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Responsive Compatibility** This release of s2Member makes the `/wp-login.php` file (the WordPress Login/Registration system) Responsive; i.e. more compatible with mobile devices and tablets. This only impacts site owners that use s2Member's Login/Registration Design options to improve and customize the appearance of this core WordPress component. No changes necessary to existing installations for this to kick-in. It's automatic (assuming you are using this s2Member feature). Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/211) if you'd like more info.
* (s2Member Pro) **Remote Operations API** This release of s2Member makes it possible to change the API Key assigned to your WordPress installation. The Pro Remote Operations API is one way for developers to integrate with some of s2Member's functionality. See: `Dashboard ⥱ s2Member ⥱ API / Scripting ⥱ Remote Operations API`. This is where it's possible to change your API Key if you'd like to. Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/206) if you'd like more info.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Enhancement** s2Member's Auto-Return system (i.e. default Thank-You page handler) which integrates with: PayPal Standard Buttons, ClickBank, and Google Wallet; has been updated in this release. If a customer happens to find their way back to a self-expiring Auto-Return URL (a rare occurrence); instead of an unfriendly error message about duplicate return data, s2Member now provides a more friendly note that asks the customer to check their email for the details needed to access what they paid for. Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/205) if you'd like more info.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Enhancement** s2Member's Security Encryption Key configuration panel in the Dashboard was updated to include additional details related to the use of your Security Encryption Key. This additional information explains s2Member's use of this key in greater detail. See: `Dashboard ⥱ s2Member ⥱ General Options ⥱ Security Encryption Key`. See also: [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/182) if you'e like more info.
* (s2Member Pro) **One-Time-Offers Upon Login** This release resolves a conflict between s2Member's Pro Login Widget and One-Time-Offers (Upon Login) — a feature that can be configured with s2Member Pro. One-Time-Offers (Upon Login) now take precedence over certain automatic login redirections that can occur through the Pro Login Widget, removing the chance of a conflict. If a visitor logs into their account with a default login redirection URL (i.e. a redirection URL formulated dynamically by the Pro Login Widget that is not related to a visitor's request to access a specific page of the site), and a One-Time-Offer is triggered at the same time, the One-Time-Offer will take precendence. The visitor will see the One-Time-Offer instead of being redirected to the default location specified by the Pro Login Widget. Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/119) if you'd like more info.

= v140725 =

* (s2Member Pro) **NEW: Stripe Pro Forms (Beta)** Holy hula hoop! s2Member now has a deep integration with Stripe for on-site credit card processing that uses a Stripe overlay. Stripe is an almost-free service that is super easy to setup and work with. We think you'll find that Stripe is quickly becoming the MOST popular of all payment gateways in the industry. A few bugs have [already been zapped](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues?milestone=5&page=1&state=closed) prior to this release after some initial beta testing was completed over the last few weeks. Everything is looking great so far, but please do [report any new issues via GitHub](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues?page=1&state=open).

  **If you are an s2Member Pro site owner** you can upgrade to the latest version of s2Member Pro at anytime you like; then enable Stripe as an additional payment gateway option. See: `Dashboard ⥱ s2Member Pro ⥱ Other Gateways`.

  **Questions About Stripe?** Please watch [this video](http://www.s2member.com/videos/L0aJz4-9mNanxemFZ_3G2-SIn-xAoiwD/) by Lead Develoer Jason Caldwell regarding s2Member's new integration with Stripe payment processing. It's never been easier! Jason answers several questions about Stripe in this video also. You might _also_ find it interesting to hear the [latest news regarding Stripe and Bitcoin](https://stripe.com/blog/bitcoin-the-stripe-perspective). We look forward to supporting Bitcoin in s2Member (via Stripe) very soon.

* (s2Member Pro) **NEW: Advanced Import/Export Tools Option** This release introduces a new "Advanced" set of user import/export tools. We think you'll find this to be an extremely helpful and much more powerful way to deal with user import/export in WordPress. Please see `Dashboard ⥱ s2Member ⥱ Import/Export` and click the link to enable the new Advanced Import/Export Tools. See also: [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/advanced-import-tools/) which documents the new tools. See also: [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/149) if you'd like further details about the development behind this new feature.
* (s2Member Pro) **ClickBank Bug Fix** Nillable fields causing some issues (only under one specific scenario) after a recent change in the ClickBank API. Fixed in this release. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/250) if you would like further detais.
* (s2Member Pro) **Compatibility** Resolved a minor single-quote issue in the Visual Editor. Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/228) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix** Non-HTML whitespace being trimmed inside the `[s2If /]` shortcode. Resolved in this release. Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/224) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member Pro) **Pro Forms Bug Fix** Related to List Server processing during an upgrade. This bug impacted all payment gateways integrated with s2Member's Pro Forms; including PayPal, Authorize.Net and now Stripe. Resolved in this release. Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/216) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix** An `array_intersect()` error in the `[s2MOP /]` shortcode under the right conditions. Fixed in this release. Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/204) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member Pro) **Enhancement** Free Registration Pro Forms can now be included in a list of nested Checkout Option drop-downs. Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/197) if you'd like further details. See also: `Dashboard ⥱ s2Member ⥱ [Your Payment Gateway] Pro Forms ⥱ Checkout Options`; where there is more information about how to use Checkout Options with s2Member Pro Forms.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix / List Servers** This release corrects a bug that may cause members to be unsubscribed from a List Server if they forget to check the box again while editing their profile. In the previous release we introduced a feature that allows the checkbox to be pre-checked if the user already chose to subscribe once before. However, the internal tracking for this was not as reliable as it could be. There is still more work to be done on this front, but the immediate issue has now been resolved. Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/196) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **WP_DEBUG Compat.** Some older portions of s2Member's codebase were cleaned up and reformatted in this update. This is an ongoing process to bring s2Member into full compatibility with `WP_DEBUG` mode in WordPress. This is intended to help other developers in the WP community. Much progress has been made on this front now, but still some more work to do. We will continue to update s2Member's codebase little-by-little with each release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Uninstall vs. Deactivation** s2Member has always made a strong effort to cleanup after itself should you decide (for whatever reason) to uninstall it. However, we are also very concerned with preserving any data associated with such a powerful plugin that comes with so many options. Nobody wants accidental data loss, right!?


  In the past, s2Member came with a feature called "Deactivation Safeguards". These (if disabled) attached themselves to a plugin "deactivation" hook within WordPress and they would uninstall s2Member when you deactivated the plugin. Starting with this release ,s2Member's Deactivation routines have been changed. We now attach them to the WordPress "uninstall" hook — which is triggered only on plugin deletion.

  In this way, deactivating s2Member will never result in a loss of any data. Instead of "Deactivation Safeguards", s2Member now calls this feature "Plugin Deletion Safeguards". In short, to tell s2Member to uninstall itself (including any data/options associated with s2Member), you can simply disable s2Member's Plugin Deletion Safeguards under: `s2Member ⥱ General Options`, and then deactivate _and delete_ the s2Member plugin entirely. Whenever you delete the plugin this automatically and silently triggers s2Member's uninstaller which cleans up after itself nicely :-)

= v140630 =

- (s2Member Pro) **Stripe Payment Gateway** Hooray! s2Member Pro now integrates with [Stripe](http://www.s2member.com/r/stripe). s2Member Pro Forms, Coupon Codes, Tax Settings, Checkout Options, and all of the other great features provided by s2Member Pro are now compatible with Stripe. To enable Stripe in your installation of s2Member, please see: `Dashboard ⥱ s2Member ⥱ Other Gateways ⥱ Stripe`.

  We expect Stripe to become the most popular payment gateway integration for s2Member Pro over the next few months. Stripe is nearly free; it's easier to setup, easier to maintain; and just more flexible overall in our opinion.

  _See also: [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/177) where  efforts to integrate with Stripe took place. A quick tutorial video and KB articles will come soon at s2Member.com; once beta testing is complete._
- (s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix; [s2MOP /]** This release corrects a bug in the `[s2MOP /]` `restriction_type` attribute. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/204) if you'd like further details.

= v140614 =

* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Quick Cache Compat.** This release makes it possible for Quick Cache to cache content protected by s2Member. If, and only if, you have [Quick Cache Pro](http://www.websharks-inc.com/product/quick-cache/) configured to enable user-specific caching; i.e. to cache when users are logged into the site. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/172) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member Pro) **ClickBank API Compat.** This release brings s2Member's ClickBank integration into full compatibility with a recent change in the ClickBank API. Under the right conditions, a symptom of this bug was to see an error regarding an unexpected `txnType` upon returning from checkout via ClickBank. Resolved in this release. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/199) if you'd like further details.

= v140603 =

* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Profile Sync to List Servers** If you have a supported List Server integrated with s2Member (e.g. MailChimp, GetResponse, AWeber), the opt-in checkbox will now also be displayed in user profile editing panels (i.e. by the `[s2Member-Profile /]` shortcode, or if you integrate s2Member with BuddyPress profiles).

  If a user updates their profile, their profile on the List Server is updated too (i.e. s2Member updates their first name, last name, along with any merge vars or customs you've integrated through s2Member hooks/filters). If a user changes their email address, they will be subscribed with the new email address. Leaving the box unchecked during a profile update will effectively unsubscribe the user from the lists you have configured at their current Membership Level.

  *s2Member's AWeber integration does not yet support profile updates (i.e. changes in first/last name or other details); it only supports the ability to either subscribe or unsubscribe; and/or changes in email address.*

  See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/146) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **BuddyPress Compatibility** This release makes s2Member and s2Member Pro compatible with the latest release of BuddyPress. BuddyPress v2.01 broke some of s2Member's previous integration. Fixed in this release. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/162) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Multisite Lost Password URL** In a multisite environment (given the WordPress default behavior), a lost password URL generated by WordPress will force all users to recover their password from the Main Site in the Network; which is usually NOT desirable. This release of s2Member fixes this odd behavior in the WordPress core by allowing users to recover their password in the UI for the current Child Blog they are accessing. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/138) if you'd like further details and ways to enable/disable; or even customize this further.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Default EOT Behavior** By popular demand, this release changes s2Member's default EOT (End Of Term) Behavior option with respect to refunds/chargebacks. The new default behavior (assuming you have not yet configured s2Member) is to force an EOT on chargebacks only; not on a refund of any kind. A refund is just a refund (in many cases) and an EOT (if one should occur) is something that a site owner generally should decide on their own; i.e. to review refunds manually and if an EOT should occur, the site owner will mostly like prefer to terminate a user's account access on their own; and on a case-by-case basis.

  **Further clarification...** EOT (End Of Term) is meant to occur when a subscription ends, and since a refund doesn't necessarily end a subscription, it's not the default anymore to trigger an automatic EOT on a refund event. Site owners that want an EOT on refunds still have that option available to them however. See `Dashboard ⥱ s2Member ⥱ [Payment Gateway] Options ⥱ Auto EOT Behavior ⥱ Chargebacks/Refunds`.

* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Currency Conversion** s2Member's integration with the Google Currency Converter went stale after some changes to the Google API. This release updates s2Member's internal currency conversion routines to correct the issue. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/169) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix** This release corrects a sortable User column issue in the WordPress Dashboard; with respect to numeric values stored in the WordPress meta table. A symptom of this bug was to see sortable columns for Last Login Time, Total Logins, or EOT Time just a bit out of whack in some scenarios. Fixed in this release. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/164) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix** Updating the inline documentation for the `[s2Drip /]` shortcode in the Dashboard to match the most recent improvements to this feature; and to bring it up-to-date with [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/s2drip-shortcode/). See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/163) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member Pro) **Enhancement** This release enhances the UI and error reporting for the `[s2Member-List /]` shortcode. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/161) if you'd like further details. See also [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/s2member-list-shortcode/).
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix** This release corrects an issue with the `[s2Member-List /]` shortcode when used on a site that does not use fancy permalinks. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/160) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix** This release adds width/height attributes to the image tags used in the s2Member Security Badges that display on-site (if you enable them); allowing them to pass a W3C validation. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/157) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member Pro) **Logging Enhancement** This release improves s2Member's log files with respect to Recurring Profiles created through PayPal Pro (Payflow Edition) and/or Authorize.Net. s2Member's automatic polling routines will now log scenarios where a user's account record is missing the original IPN Signup Vars that should be present on a site running s2Member Pro. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/websharks/s2member/issues/104) if you'd like further details.

= v140520 =

* (s2Member Pro) **`[s2Member-List /]` Shortcode** Amazing new feature! It is now possible to list members using a powerful shortcode, and even make it possible for members to view and search for each other. See [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/?p=62860) for all the details on this feature. Very cool!
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Server-Side Validation** For Registration/Profile Fields that you configure on your own (using the s2Member software), there is now support within all areas of the s2Member codebase for both JavaScript and *now server-side validation too*. In the past, all validations applied to custom fields was via JavaScript only. With server-side validation too, now it is impossible for required and/or invalid fields that you configure to go missing. This also resolves a few issues related to spam bots attempting to bypass JavaScript validation. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/99) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member Pro) **Button Processing Animation**. Improving the processing animation used in submit buttons across Pro Forms. Instead of a script-based solution (rather jumpy), we are now taking advantage of CSS3 for a much smoother animation. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/114) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member Pro) **`[s2Drip /]` Shortcode Enhancement** This release adds support for a new `access=""` shortcode attribute that can parse `and` / `or` logic. Also, it is now possible for `[s2Drip /]` to be used with Custom Capabilities too! See [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/s2drip-shortcode/) for all the details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix, Custom Fields UI** This release corrects a bug related to the `jquery/.htaccess` file that ships with s2Member. A symptom was to have issues with the Registration/Profile Fields UI and find a JS error in the browser's developer console. Fixed in this release. See also, [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/144#issuecomment-43198045) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix, Clickbank HTTPS** This release corrects a bug in the default Auto-Return Page for ClickBank, when/if it's served over the `https` protocol. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/145) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Sortable User Columns** This release adds support for sortable user columns in the Dashboard, where possible. Things like EOT Time, Registration Time, Last Login Time, Total Logins, etc. NOTE: it is currently NOT possible to sort by Custom Registration/Profile Fields (yet). See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/147) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Hook Priority for Translations** This release corrects a bug related to Gettext translations. There were a couple of areas within s2Member that weren't picking up all of the translation entries; caused by a conflict in hook priority. Fixed in this release. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/132) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member Pro) **`[s2MOP /]` Shortcode Enhancement** A new Replacement Code was added: `%%REQUIRED_LEVEL_LABEL%%`. See [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/s2mop-shortcode/) and [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/129) if you'd like further details.

= v140423 =

* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **WP v3.9 Compatibility**. Resolving an incompatibility between s2Member and WP v3.9 where s2Member was attempting to use the jQuery `highlight` effect no longer available by default; starting with WP v3.9. A symptom of this bug was to have problems closing the dialog box when creating new Registration/Profile Fields with s2Member in the WP Dashboard. See also [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/108).
* (s2Member Pro) **User Export Limitation**. Adding an option to the Import/Export panel used to export Users from your installation of WordPress. This new option makes it possible to specify an exact number of maximum rows to export; instead of the previous behavior which forced to a value of `1000` max. See also [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/80).
* (s2Member Pro) **s2Drip Enhancement**. Updating the s2Drip shortcode to allow for a time frame that specifies `from_day="1" to_day="1"`.

For instructions on how to use the `[s2MOP]` shortcode see [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/s2mop-shortcode/).
* (s2Member Pro). **s2MOP Enhancement**. Improving `[s2MOP]` Replacement Codes overall by converting internal slugs into textual labels for an improved user experience. Also making it possible to filter the default labels. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member-Pro/pull/10). For instructions on how to use the `[s2MOP]` shortcode see [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/s2mop-shortcode/).
* (s2Member Pro) **s2MOP Enhancement**. Adding support for nested shortcodes inside the `[s2MOP]` shortcode. For instructions on how to use the `[s2MOP]` shortcode see [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/s2mop-shortcode/).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Time Tracking**. This release begins tracking some additional timestamps to be used by features coming in a future version of s2Member. A new routine was added internally to go ahead and begin tracking some additional timestamps associated with the addition and/or removal of specific Membership Levels and/or Custom Capabilities. A future release of s2Member will take advantage of this data in some of it's shortcodes and API Functions (coming soon). See also [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/84).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix**. A bug related to domain validation against some of the latest TLDs like `.photography` or `.solutions` has been resolved with this release. See also [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/98).

= v140409 =

* (s2Member Pro) **s2MOP Shortcode**. A new shortcode is now available for site owners running s2Member Pro: `[s2MOP]`. For further details, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member ⥱ API / Scripting ⥱ Membership Options Page / Variables`. See also: [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/s2mop-shortcode/).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility**. Reviewed by Lead Developer Jason Caldwell for full compatibility against WordPress v3.9. s2Member also remains backward compatible with WP v3.3 - 3.8.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Security Review**. Reviewed by Lead Developer Jason Caldwell to look closer at any portions of s2Member which might be impacted by the [OpenSSL Heartbleed bug](http://heartbleed.com/). Please note, the Heartbleed bug is NOT an s2Member bug. It is a bug in the OpenSSL library used by many services across the web. Please see this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/90) where Jason posted a few tips for site owners running the s2Member software.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **s2 MOP Vars**. The format of s2Member's MOP Vars has been updated in this release. Backward compatibility remains for the older formats, so this should not cause any problems for site owners using the older formats provided by previous versions of s2Member. For further details, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member ⥱ API / Scripting ⥱ Membership Options Page / Variables`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **s2 MOP Vars**. s2Member MOP Vars are now an optional feature. It is now possible to disable the additional variables that s2Member appends to the end of your Membership Options Page URL when it redirects a visitor without access to something you've restricted. To configure this new option, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member ⥱ General Options ⥱ Membership Options Page`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix**. Updating core IPN handler to correct a PHP warning `array to string conversion`. A symptom was to see warnings in your PHP error log when using a custom Thank-You page. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix**. Updating the new EOT Time column in the list of WP Users so it displays a human readable date and time; as opposed to a UNIX timestamp. Fixed in this release.

= v140328 =

* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility**. Updated to support WordPress v3.9. Nothing significant, just minor UI tweaks to make s2Member fully compatible with WP v3.9.
* (s2Member) **Compatibility**. Updating for backward compatibility with WordPress v3.8 - 3.3 by tweaking calls to `get_post()`. See this [commit](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/commit/7b8c8aecc3e8d0d0bada3e80f41615b968a763f8) for further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Translations**. Updating the `includes/translations/s2member.pot` [file](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/tree/000000-dev/s2member/includes/translations) to include the entire set of translation strings for both s2Member and s2Member Pro. Some translation entries from JS files were missing in the previous release due to a glitch in our WP i18n processor. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member) **Server Check Tool**. Updating the [s2Member Server Scanner](https://www.s2member.com/kb/server-scanner/) to exclude checksum validations against README files. This release includes other scanning improvements also, which allow the tool to do a better job of scanning for compatibility issues.
* (s2Member Pro) **GetResponse Integration**. This release adds support for GetResponse™ as an email service provider. s2Member now comes preintegrated with GetResponse™ (requires s2Member Pro), MailChimp® and AWeber™ too.
* (s2Member) **Double Opt-In Article**. Updating inline documentation to include further details about Double Opt-Ins via [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/double-opt-in-checkbox/).
* (s2Member) **Compatibility**. Adding support for `$_SERVER['WP_DIR']` (to help developers with a particular edge case). For further details please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/39).
* (s2Member) **Auto-EOT Time Column**. This release adds an Auto-EOT Time column to the list of Users in the WordPress Dashboard. Note: it is possible to show/hide specific columns with the Screen Options tab in WordPress.
* (s2Member) **HTML Trimming**. Adding a new utility method to the s2Member codebase. This [method](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/commit/aa19d23511e9c34a5cc00628285107da9a565594) helps cleanup HTML-based whitespace (and extra line breaks) that are injected inadvertently by some themes when site owners use the `[s2If]` shortcode.
* (s2Member) **Bug Fix**. Fixing an issue related to Login Redirections over SSL. For further details please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/59).
* (s2Member) **All Custom Capabilities**. If your site offers many different CCAPS (Custom Capabilities) and you'd like a way to sell someone access to all of them at once (without needing to list each of them one-by-one); this is now possible. This is accomplished by selling a customer the special CCAP `all_ccaps`. If the `current_user_can('access_s2member_ccap_all_ccaps')`, they will be granted access to ALL Custom Capabilities that you've implemented on the site (now, and in the future). For instance, if the `current_user_can('access_s2member_ccap_all_ccaps')` they can also `access_s2member_ccap_music` even if they don't actually have CCAP `music`. In short, `all_ccaps` grants a customer access to all CCAPS automatically.
* (s2Member) **E_NOTICE**. Updating several areas of the s2Member codebase in an ongoing effort to make s2Member behave as expected when running in `WP_DEBUG` mode. Note that `WP_DEBUG` is NOT recommended for a production site (this mode is reserved for developers only please).
* (s2Member) **Bug Fix**. Fixing a bug related to redirections over SSL in an edge case. See [this GitHub commit](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/commit/881a8f513ff00d1932f33928c771cab38ab84dc7) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member) **Bug Fix**. Fixing a bug in the way s2Member handles IP Restrictions in one particular area of the source code. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/63) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member) **File Downloads (Content-Encoding)**. Adding a new configurable option for site owners that use protected File Downloads with s2Member. There is a known issue on some hosting platforms; and this new configurable option provides a workaround that is related to the `Content-Encoding` header. Please see: `Dashboard ⥱ s2Member ⥱ Download Options ⥱ Preventing GZIP Conflicts` to configure this new setting. See also [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/70) if you'd like further details.
* (s2Member) **Apache Compatibility**. Updating s2Member's `.htaccess` files to provide support for the `Require` directive supplied by the `authz_core_module` in the most recent versions of Apache. s2Member also maintains backward compatibility for the `allow/deny` directives used in previous versions of Apache.
* (s2Member Pro) **Gateway-Specific Variables**. Adding gateway-specific variables for use in email templates configured with s2Member. For further details please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/25).
* (s2Member) **Cosmetics**. Updating s2Member's adminitrative menu pages to enhance their appearance in the most recent versions of WordPress. Nothing significant, just minor tweaks.
* (s2Member Pro) **PayPal IPNs**. Adding support for `txn_type` values: `merch_pmt`, `mp_signup`, and `mp_cancel` to enhance s2Member's support for Billing Agreements when integrated together with a PayPal Pro (Payflow Edition) account that processes Express Checkout transactions. This also resolves a bug related to cancellation IPN processing in a specific scenario. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member Pro) **[s2If][else]**. Requires s2Member Pro. This release adds support for a new `[else]` condition when using the `[s2If]` shortcode to protect parts of your content. For examples, please see: `Dashboard ⥱ s2Member ⥱ API Scripting ⥱ Simple Shortcode Conditionals`. See also: `Dashboard ⥱ s2Member ⥱ Restriction Options ⥱ Simple Shortcode Conditionals`.
* (s2Member Pro) **[s2If php=""]**. Requires s2Member Pro. This release adds support for a new `php` Shortcode Attribute; e.g. `[s2If php=""]`. This makes it possible to use arbitrary PHP code in your `[s2If]` shortcodes. For examples, please see: `Dashboard ⥱ s2Member ⥱ API Scripting ⥱ Simple Shortcode Conditionals`. **Note: this feature is disabled by default.** You must enable the `php` attribute for this to work as expected. Please see: `Dashboard ⥱ s2Member ⥱ Restriction Options ⥱ Simple Shortcode Conditionals` (with s2Member Pro installed).
* (s2Member) **Bug Fix**. Correcting an issue related to Login Redirections and an E_NOTICE. Please see [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/75) if you'd like further details.

* (s2Member Pro) **PayPal Express Checkout**. Updating PayPal Express Checkout cancellation links so they will automatically use the PayPal Merchant ID supplied by a site owner (i.e. PayPal's recommended behavior). If you'd like further details please see [this GitHub commit](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member-Pro/commit/5efbe35eed352868a956c94e51ab09f8e561892a).
* (s2Member Pro) **Pro Forms**. Adding a new filter for developers `s2member_pro_cancels_old_rp_before_new_rp`. This is true by default. If you'd like to prevent s2Member from terminating an existing Recurring Profile (before creating a new one); i.e. during an upgrade... you can set this to a FALSE value. Not recommended, but there are a few edge cases where it could be helpful for developers. See also [this GitHub commit](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member-Pro/commit/19a84c81070bb0e1869b5dbd9d0325cc458fd016).
* (s2Member Pro) **ClickBank Bug Fix**. Adding support for alphabetics in ClickBank Item Numbers. This bug impacted the ClickBank Button Generator only, it did not prevent alphabetics from being used in a raw Shortcode. Still, this has been resolved now. See also [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/46).
* (s2Member Pro) **PayPal Mobile Bug Fix**. This release corrects a bug related to the `MAXAMT` PayPal specification that is sent via Express Checkout on a mobile device. A symptom of this bug was to sometimes see PayPal's awkward default amount of `$25` when completing checkout on a mobile device. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member Pro) **PayPal Express Checkout**. This release addresses an issue where a customer reaches PayPal.com with an item description that inadequately reads "Future payment" (i.e. missing the description provided by a site owner). PayPal's latest improvements have made it possible for s2Member to get this right. Resolved in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Partial Refunds**. This release adds support for Partial Refunds in the s2Member EOT Behavior Options. See also [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/40).

= v140105 =

* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility**. Updated to support WordPress v3.8. Nothing significant, just minor UI tweaks in the Login/Registration Design for WordPress v3.8; e.g. `wp-login.php` got some minor improvements in this release of s2Member and s2Member Pro.
* (s2Member) **Compatibility**. PayPal's API for Subscription Cancellation Buttons was changed recently. PayPal now requires a Merchant ID instead of the site owner's email address. This issue has been causing an error when a user attempts to cancel a PayPal Subscription through an s2Member-generated PayPal Subscription Cancellation "Button" (i.e. this affects Buttons only, not Pro Forms). Fixed in this release. Site owners using PayPal Buttons should update their PayPal Merchant ID for s2Member. Please see: `Dashboard ⥱ s2Member ⥱ PayPal Options ⥱ Account Details`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility**. Default s2Member option value for CSS/JS Lazy Loading is now off instead of on; e.g. s2Member's CSS/JS JavaScript libraries are now loaded on every page by default. Lazy loading must now be enabled by a site owner as a performance enhancement (optional). For further details, please see: `Dashboard ⥱ s2Member ⥱ General Options ⥱ CSS/JS Lazy Loading`.
* (s2Member Pro) **Remote Operations API**. This release introduces two new API methods; `auth_check_user` and `get_user`. These methods (combined with those which already exist in s2Member Pro) now make s2Member Pro's Remote Operations API a pleasure to work with. For further details, please see: `Dashboard ⥱ s2Member Pro ⥱ API Scripting ⥱ Pro Remote Operations API`. Here you will find the API Key for your installation, along with several code samples.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Logging**. s2Member's core payment gateway processors now log to files `gateway-core-ipn.log` and `gateway-core-rtn.log`. These log file names were changed in this release. In previous versions of s2Member these log entries were kept inside `paypal-ipn.log` and `paypal-rtn.log`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Updates**. The XML/RSS feed box for the most recent s2Member Updates (for site owners only; in the Dashboard); has been updated to our newest feed location at: `http://feeds.feedburner.com/s2member`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix**. s2Member should follow redirects in API calls to Amazon.com. See: <https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/35> for further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix**. By default, do not count login IP Restrictions against users who can `edit_posts`. See: <https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/32> for further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix**. Sleep offset to `10` seconds for `subscr_eot`. See <https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/34> for further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Enhancement**. Updating the "s2" icon in the Dashboard to our most recent version.
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix**. s2Member Pro now accepts `TOO MANY FAILURES` as an EOT response type status under PayPal Pro (Payflow Edition) accounts. This was previously causing a problem against newer PayPal Pro accounts (w/ the Payflow Edition); whereby some customers who were reaching Max Failed Payments were not being demoted properly in all cases. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility**. Adding support for `$_SERVER['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION']` when s2Member is used for Remote Auth file hosting. Some servers do not support `$_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER']`. Instead, s2Member can get the username/password by parsing them out of `$_SERVER['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION']` when/if necessary. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **PHP Debug Notices.** Updating s2Member's source code to further prevent PHP debug notices when running in `WP_DEBUG` mode. This is part of an ongoing effort keep s2Member running smoothly in PHP strict mode; and to maintain conformity with WordPress standards.
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix**. Define `abbr_bytes()` method as static to prevent issues during automatic upgrades of s2Member Pro. Please see <https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/37> for further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Backward Compatibility.** Updating calls to `get_post()`. We're adding a `NULL` argument via `$null` to prevent warnings in older releases of WordPress where an argument was required; e.g. `$null = NULL; get_post($null)`.

= v131126 =

* (s2Member Pro) **Google Wallet.** s2Member Pro now supports [Google Wallet for Digital Goods](https://developers.google.com/commerce/wallet/digital/).

 In the past we offered support for Google "Checkout" (Google "Checkout" is no longer available as of November 2013). s2Member's previous integration with Google Checkout has now been fully updated to support Google "Wallet" for Digital Goods. To enable Google Wallet in your installation of s2Member Pro, please see: `Dashboard -› s2Member Pro -› Other Gateways -› Google Wallet`. For setup instructions, please see: `Dashboard -› s2Member Pro -› Google Options`.

 At the time of this writing, there are no KB articles related to Google Wallet at s2Member.com (yet); these will come soon. Until then, you might find it helpful to review dev notes by Jason Caldwell (Lead Developer). Please see: <https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/issues/19>.

 We also suggest that you review the documentation in your Dashboard under: `s2Member Pro -› Google Options` and `s2Member Pro -› Google Buttons`. If you were previously using Google "Checkout", please review [this notice posted by Google](https://support.google.com/checkout/sell/answer/3080449?hl=en).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bootstrap Compatibility.** s2Member has been updated throughout to support the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework when running on a WordPress theme that's been built on Bootstrap. For instance; profile editing forms, custom registration/profile fields, s2Member Pro Forms for checkout/registration; these will now look good on sites powered by Bootstrap. This change has no impact on functionality, only on appearance; and only IF your site is powered by Bootstrap. Throughout s2Member's HTML code we've added CSS class names that follow a Bootstrap standard. These Bootstrap classes are blended together with default structural styles that makes s2Member compatible with all WordPress themes. This way s2Member (and s2Member Pro) can produce a clean/professional appearance on just about any WordPress theme; and now Bootstrap is supported too!
* (s2Member Pro) **Configurable Emails.** We've added new configuration panels into the s2Member UI for a Modification Confirmation Email and also for the Custom Capability Confirmation Email. These are now configurable for all payment gateways integrated with s2Member Pro; e.g. AliPay, ccBill, ClickBank, Google Wallet, Authorize.Net, PayPal Standard, and PayPal Pro. These emails have always existed, but up until now customization required a WordPress filter. Now it's easier, you can customize these from the Dashboard! Please note: this feature comes only with s2Member Pro. As one example, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member Pro -› PayPal Options -› Modification Confirmation Email`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Snippets/Redirects.** Snippets and Redirects no longer carry the s2Member Restriction Options meta box in the Post/Page editing station; there's no need for Restrictions against these two special Post Types. This change, together with the latest improvements in these two plugins: [WP Snippets](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-snippets/) and [WP Redirects](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-redirects/) (also produced by our team) offer a more powerful solution now that all of these plugins are more compatible with each other.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Backward Compatibility.** Updating calls to `get_post()`. We're adding a `NULL` argument to prevent warnings in older releases of WordPress where an argument was required; e.g. `get_post(NULL)`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Forward Compatibility.** Adding support for the `relative` scheme in SSL filters that deal with `set_url_scheme()` in the latest versions of WordPress. This improves s2Member's "force SSL mode" where a site owner sets the Custom Field for a Post/Page; e.g. `s2member_force_ssl` is set to `yes`. This change will better support themes/plugins that use absolute relative paths together with WordPress core functions like `site_url()` and `home_url()`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **PHP Debug Notices.** Updating s2Member's source code to further prevent PHP debug notices when running in `WP_DEBUG` mode. This is part of an ongoing effort keep s2Member running smoothly in PHP strict mode; and to maintain conformity with WordPress standards.
* (s2Member Pro) **Unlimited Membership Levels.** Updating the built-in software documentation for s2Member Pro to cover an edge case where a site owner many choose to exceed the recommended maximum for Membership Levels when running s2Member Pro. If you intend to use more than `100` Membership Levels (this is not recommended); but if you do, please see: `Dashboard -› s2Member Pro -› General Options -› Membership Levels/Labels` for the latest details on this.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Dropping IE8 Support.** s2Member and s2Member Pro will no longer support IE8 in any official capacity. s2Member's HTML output and CSS files have been cleaned up; and all hacks related to IE8 have been removed. Out with the old, in with the new! We need to keep s2Member up-to-date with the latest improvements offered by IE9 and other modern browsers. While s2Member may continue to function relatively well in IE8, hacks used in the past to accomodate edge cases in this buggy browser have been removed in favor of standards compliance.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Lazy Loading CSS/JS.** s2Member now offers site owners the option to enable/disable lazy loading of CSS/JS libraries provided by the s2Member software. For further details, please see: `Dashboard -› s2Member -› General Options -› CSS/JS Lazy Loading`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix.** s2Member and s2Member Pro have both been updated to prevent spaces in a comma-delimited list of Custom Capabilities; e.g. `ccaps="music, videos"` should be `ccaps="music,videos"` please. Spaces in this list have never been allowed, but now there is better server-side validation to prevent this from happening; reducing the chance of error when a site owner configures a Button or Pro Form shortcode with s2Member.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Other Minor Bug Fixes.** Please see: <https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/commits/000000-dev>

= v131109 =

* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **UI Makeover** This release of s2Member upgrades all administrative UI panels.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility** Updating s2Member for compatibility with the coming release of both Quick Cache LITE and Quick Cache Pro for WordPress. These are not available publicly yet, but they are expected for release very soon. This release of s2Member is compatible with both the current and future releases of Quick Cache for WordPress.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Improvement (Speed)** Lazy load s2Member's JS file at all times. Done, this release will speed your site up for first-time visitors.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Improvement (Speed)** Lazy load s2Member's CSS file at all times. Done, this release will speed your site up for first-time visitors.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Improvement (Speed)** Load s2Member's JS library in the footer if at all possible (instead of the `<head>`). Done, this will improve the speed of your site for first-time visitors.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Debug Notices** Resolved all of the most obvious PHP notices when running s2Member in debug mode. This improvement impacts developers only.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Password Strength Meter** Removed dependence on `password-strength-meter` (a JavaScript library) from the WordPress core. This was causing some SSL issues for site owners. In the past it was necessary for s2Member to load an additional JS resource for registration/checkout and Pro Forms (`password-strength-meter`). Starting with this release, s2Member handles password strength meters all by itself, thereby avoiding the additional overhead; and also the issues associated with this core functionality over SSL pages. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Mobile Devices** The s2Stream shortcode (for protected audio/video files) was updated to better support mobile device playback. See also: <http://www.s2member.com/kb/jwplayer-s2stream-shortcodes/#s2stream-mobile-devices>.
* (s2Member Pro) **Checkout Options** Improving support for multiple Checkout Options. When a customer changes to a new Checkout Option by selecting an option from the drop-down menu in a Pro Form; this action will now result in a hash jump back to the location of the Pro Form on any given page; instead of to the top of the page, which could potentially result in a confusing experience on some sites (depending on the implementation). Aside: for developers, it's helpful to know that all s2Member Pro Forms now have a hashable ID `#s2p-form` that is cleaner than the longer (product-specific) IDs associated with Pro Forms; e.g. `s2member-pro-paypal-form...`, etc. If you need to hash a Pro Form, please use the more general `#s2p-form` on the end of a URL. This will take a customer directly to that Pro Form in the context of any given page.

= v131026 =

* (s2Member) **WordPress v3.7 Compatibility** s2Member further updated to support subtle changes in the WordPress v3.7 `wp-login.php` file. This release corrects a minor issue w/ patches applied by s2Member when running in a Multisite Network environment. If you are running s2Member on a Multisite Network, please be sure to run the automatic patcher provided in your Dashboard against WordPress v3.7 after updating to this release of s2Member.
* (s2Member Pro) **PayPal Central IPN** Updating the example file: `s2m-pro-extras/paypal-central-ipn.php` to use one of the latest PayPal IP addresses listed [here](https://ppmts.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/92).

= v131025 =

* (s2Member) **WordPress v3.7 Compatibility** s2Member updated to support WordPress v3.7. s2Member remains compatible with WP v3.3 (or higher).
* (s2Member Pro) **New Feature: Simultaneous Login Monitoring** Available only w/ s2Member Pro. s2Member Pro has been updated to support configurations that limit the number of simultaneous logins a single username can receive. For further details, please see: `Dashboard -› s2Member -› Restriction Options -› Simultaneous Login Restrictions` (when s2Member Pro is installed).
* (s2Member) **Post Restrictions (#3)** Adding support for `all-[post type]` in addition to the existing `all-[post type]s` (plural) currently supported by s2Member's Restriction Options for Posts. This makes it possible for a site owner to type only the Post Type after the keyword prefix `all-`; and excluding the plural `s` in cases when this is necessary.
* (s2Member) **Documentation Update (#3)** Adding note in Download Options panel regarding `raw` shortcode tags around Shortcodes when using the inFocus theme. See also [this thread](http://mysitemyway.com/support/topic/infocus-adding-tags-into-plugin-content) for further details.
* (s2Member) **Documentation Cleanup (#12)** General cleanup in several s2Member panels to improve inline documentation that comes w/ the software. Branding improvements, padding adjustments, and subtle textual changes.
* (s2Member) **Bug Fix (#11)** Running `isset()` against `$cache_needs_updating` to prevent NOTICE when running in `WP_DEBUG` mode.
* (s2Member) **Optimization (#9)** Removing all image source files (.fla and .pspimage) from the official distribution package to reduce overall filesize.
* (s2Member) **Quick Start Video (#10)** Adding Quick Start playlist to Quick Start section.
* (s2Member) **UI (#6)** Reducing padding around section headers in s2Member option panels to reduce the amount of space these consume.
* (s2Member Pro) **SSL** Forcing all automatic updates of s2Member Pro to occur over SSL for improved security.
* (s2Member) **Login Welcome Page** Improving support for new feature (force HTTP redirection). See: `s2Member -› General Options -› Login Welcome Page` for details on how this feature works.
* (s2Member) **Bug Fix: Registration/Profile Fields** Adding space between checkboxes and their labels.
* (s2Member) **ClickBank IPN Filter** Adding a new filter to s2Member's ClickBank IPN handler for developers integrating s2Member in creative ways: `c_ws_plugin__s2member_pro_clickbank_notify_handles_completions`. Defaults to a TRUE value. Forcing this filter to a FALSE value will prevent s2Member from handling term completions via IPN communication; in cases where it's preferred that a site owner deal with this specific scenario manually.
* (s2Member) **Conformity** Updating calls to `$wpdb->escape` changing to `esc_sql` to conform w/ WordPress standards.
* (s2Member Pro) **Compatibility: Checkout Options** Improving theme support for Checkout Options created using Pro Forms by wrapping other Pro Form Shortcodes. Some site owners reported line break injections in the previous verison. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member) **See also: s2Member Repo** https://github.com/WebSharks/s2Member/commits/000000-dev

= v130816 =

* (s2Member Pro) **Compatibility, ClickBank (#467)** Improving support for ClickBank PitchPlus Upsell Flows. Please see [this thread](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/clickbank-buttons-not-working/#post-55725) for further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **User Search on Multisite Networks (#468)** User search functionality was partially broken for Child Blogs in a Multisite Network after some improvements were implemented in s2Member® v130731. The issue has now been corrected in this release for Multisite Networks. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/user-search-no-longer-working/#post-55778).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Z-Index in Menu Pages (#461)** Stacking order against a WordPress® installation running a Dashboard with a collapsed sidebar menu (left side) was causing some UI problems. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **SSL Compatibility (#437)** Adding a new option in the `s2Member® -› General Options -› Login Welcome Page` section. The default value for this new option is always `yes`. However, the default functionality can be turned off (if you prefer). This new option allows site owners to better integrate with a core WordPress® feature commonly referred to as `FORCE_SSL_LOGIN` and/or `FORCE_SSL_ADMIN`. This new feature can be used, or not. It is intended mainly for site owners running w/ `FORCE_SSL_LOGIN` and/or `FORCE_SSL_ADMIN`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Login/Registration Design Option (#437)** Adding a new option in the `s2Member® -› General Options -› Login/Registration Design` section. This new option (found at the bottom of `s2Member® -› General Options -› Login/Registration Design`) allows a site owner to show/hide the `Back To Home Page` link at the bottom of the default WordPress® Login/Registration system. This can be useful for site owners running w/ `FORCE_SSL_LOGIN` and/or `FORCE_SSL_ADMIN`; where they would prefer NOT to link customers back to the main site under a default HTTPS link; but rather, create their own link and gain better control over this area of their site.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Videos (#467)** Updating internal documentation found in `Dashboard -› s2Member® -› Quick-Start`. Specifically, the video player here was integrated with an older version of the YouTube® API and was not working properly. Fixed in this release.

= v130802 =

* (s2Member Pro) **Compatibility, WordPress® v3.6** Updating s2Member® Pro Form templates and their underlying CSS. This update improves their appearance against the Twenty Thirteen theme that comes with WordPress® v3.6. Specifically, some of the Pro Form buttons were a little out of place in this new default theme. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member Pro) **Compatibility, Checkout Options (#443)** Revision 3. Updating this feature to support a wider variety of WordPress® configurations and content filters. This update also resolves an empty `desc=""` attribute error reported by some site owners. Feature description... It is now possible to build dropdown menus offering your customers a variety of options using a Single Pro Form. This is accomplished quite easily using Shortcodes. For full details and examples, please check this section of your Dashboard in the latest release. See: `s2Member® -› PayPal® Pro Forms -› Wrapping Multiple Shortcodes as "Checkout Options"`. NOTE: this works for PayPal® Pro Forms, and ALSO for Authorize.Net Pro Forms.

= v130801 =

* (s2Member Pro) **New Feature; Checkout Options (#403)** Revision 2. Updating documentation on this new feature to prevent conufusion for site owners. s2Member® Pro now supports "Checkout Options". It is now possible to build dropdown menus offering your customers a variety of options using a Single Pro Form. This is accomplished quite easily using Shortcodes. For full details and examples, please check this section of your Dashboard in the latest release. See: `s2Member® -› PayPal® Pro Forms -› Wrapping Multiple Shortcodes as "Checkout Options"`. NOTE: this works for PayPal® Pro Forms, and ALSO for Authorize.Net Pro Forms.

= v130731 =

* (s2Member Pro) **New Feature; Checkout Options (#403)** s2Member® Pro now supports "Checkout Options". It is now possible to build dropdown menus offering your customers a variety of options using a Single Pro Form. This is accomplished quite easily using Shortcodes. For full details and examples, please check this section of your Dashboard in the latest release. See: `s2Member® -› PayPal® Pro Forms -› Wrapping Multiple Shortcodes as "Checkout Options"`. NOTE: this works for PayPal® Pro Forms, and ALSO for Authorize.Net Pro Forms.
* (s2Member Pro) **Free Checkout (#403)** It is now possible to offer a 100% free checkout experience using any of s2Member's Pro Form Shortcodes. In previous releases of s2Member® it was not possible to set the `ra=""` Attribute to a zero dollar amount. Now it is! This works for PayPal® Pro Forms, and also for Authorize.Net Pro Forms.
* (s2Member Pro) **100% Off Coupons (#403)** It is now possible to offer a 100% off coupon. This works for PayPal® Pro Forms, and also for Authorize.Net Pro Forms. See: `s2Member® -› Pro Coupon Codes` for details and examples.
* (s2Member Pro) **Expiration Date Dropdowns (#428)** This release improves all s2Member® Pro Form templates by adding dropdown menus for the customer's credit card expiration month/year instead of the simple text input field used in previous releases.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **MySQL Wait Timeout (#349)** s2Member now automatically increases the MySQL `wait_timeout` to `300` seconds during s2Member processing routines. Reason for increase: should any 3rd party service API result in unexpected connection timeouts (such as PayPal, Authorize.Net, Amazon, MailChimp, AWeber, etc); this may cause a delay that could potentially exceed the default `wait_timeout` of `30` seconds on the MySQL resource handle that is global to all of WordPress. Increasing `wait_timeout` before transaction processing will decrease the chance of failure after a timeout is exceeded. Among other things, this resolves an elusive bug where there are mysterious 404 errors after checkout under the right scenario (e.g. when an unexpected timeout occurs). This may also resolve problems associated w/ some mysterious reports where emails were not sent during s2Member's attempt to complete post-processing of a transaction (and/or where other portions of post-processing failed under rare circumstances).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Alternative Views (#300)** This release gives s2Member® the ability to hide protected content in widgets that list protected WordPress® Pages. This is a new Alternative View in the Dashboard. See: `s2Member® -› Restriction Options -› Alternative Views` for further details please.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Documentation Update (#350)** Subtle improvements to the built-in documentation pertaining to s2Member's Automatic List Transitioning feature in the Dashboard. See: `s2Member® -› API/List Servers -› Automatic Unsubscribes` for further details please.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix (#387)** In s2Member® Only mode, a recursive scan for the WordPress® `/wp-load.php` file was failing somtimes when/if a custom directory was configured for plugins. Fixed in this release. See [this thread](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/problem-with-wordpress-folder-search-code/) for further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix (#418)** Fixed incorrect pagination of user search results in the Dashboard.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix (#418)** Fixed slow query against user searches in the Dashboard.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix (#418)** Fixed incorrect result totals under some rare scenarios in user search results.

= v130617 =

* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **IP Restrictions (#148)** It is now possible to introduce a custom template file that controls the error message displayed when/if a user breaches security by exceeding your maximum unique IP addresses; as configured under `s2Member -› Restriction Options -› Unique IP Restrictions`. If you would like to use a custom template for this message, please copy the default template file from `/s2member/includes/templates/errors/ip-restrictions.php` and place this file into your active WordPress® theme directory (or into the `/wp-content/` directory if you prefer). s2Member will automatically find your custom template in one of these locations; and s2Member will use your custom template instead of the built-in default.
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix (#302)** Updating Authorize.Net Pro Form Generator to support max days of `365` instead of `7`.
* (s2Member Pro) **Amazon S3 Secret Access Keys (#321)** Updating UI configuration panel to better explain what a Secret Access Key is; and adding a note about Secret Access Keys for Amazon S3 integration. Amazon® is deprecating Secret Access Keys, but they ARE still required for digitally signed URLs. This update changes nothing in s2Member's functionality. It simply adds some additional detail to a configuration field that will assist site owners integrating s2Member w/ Amazon S3 for the first time.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Translations (#317)** Updating `/s2member/includes/translations/translations.txt` (README file). Adding blurp about fuzzy translation entries in existing PO files that translate s2Member. This contains some additional tips on how to update existing PO files upon each release of s2Member and/or s2Member Pro.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix (#321)** Fixing bug in `/s2member/includes/templates/cfg-files/s2-cross-xml.php` for S3 Buckets (resulting in `crossdomain.xml`). This file contained a parse error and was causing some problems for site owners integrating Adobe Flash content served via Amazon S3. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member Pro) **PayPal Pro Forms (#315)** Adding note in the Dashboard here (`s2Member -› PayPal Pro Forms -› Shortcode Attributes Explained`). In the list of Shortcode Attributes we are adding a note regarding max character length for the `desc=""` Attribute in a PayPal Pro Form Shortcode. This can be as long as you like. However, all descriptions passed through PayPal® APIs are truncated automatically to 60 characters max (e.g. the maximum allowed length for PayPal® descriptions is 60 characters). Nothing new here, but we thought it would be a good idea to clarify this behavior in the documentation. Updated in this release.
* (s2Member Pro) **PayPal Pro Forms (#312)** Preventing the use of multiple Pro Forms in the same Post/Page. This has never been possible, it is known to break the functionality of s2Member Pro Forms. Please limit Pro Form Shortcodes to ONE for each Post/Page; and do NOT attempt to use more than one Pro Form Shortcode on the same Post/Page (at the same time). In this release we have added a friendly JavaScript alert/warning for site owners that attempt this, so that problems and confusion can be avoided in this unlikely scenario.

= v130513 =

* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **s2Stream Shortcode Bug Fix (#256)** Fixing a bug first introduced in the previous release where we added support for `player_aspectratio`. This quick update corrects the PHP parse error at line #154 of `sc-files-in.inc.php`. It also corrects the behavior of the `player_height=""` and `player_aspectratio=""` Shortcode Attributes for the `s2Stream` Shortcode. Many thanks to everyone that reported this bug.
* (s2Member Pro) **Codestyling Localization** Removing symlink creator for Codestyleing Localization compatibility. There have been some reports of problems during WordPress® automatic upgrades (when/if the symlink exists). Until we can find a way to avoid this, we're disabling the automatic symlink generator. If you're running the Codestyling Localization plugin together with s2Member Pro, you will need to create the symlink yourself if you want to make s2Member fully compatible. Please create a symlink here: `/wp-content/plugins/s2member/s2member-pro` that points to the s2Member Pro directory: `/wp-content/plugins/s2member-pro`. See notes in previous changelog for further details on this.

 **IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you upgraded previously to v130510 (and you ran the Codestyling Localization plugin together with s2Member® v130510 — at any time); please delete this symlink via FTP: `/wp-content/plugins/s2member/s2member-pro`. Please do this BEFORE attempting an automatic upgrade via WordPress®.

 If you missed this note and you've already attempted an automatic upgrade, you will have trouble. Here's how to correct the problem.

 1. Log into your site via FTP and delete these two directories manually.
  `/wp-content/plugins/s2member` and `/wp-content/plugins/s2member-pro`.

 2. Now, please follow the [instructions here](http://www.s2member.com/pro/#!s2_tab_jump=s2-pro-install-update) to upgrade s2Member® Pro manually.

= v130510 =

* (s2Member Pro) **Authorize.Net UK (and Other Currencies) (#104)** Adding support for Authorize.Net UK and other currencies too. s2Member Pro now officially supports Authorize.Net UK Edition. It is now possible to change your Authorize.Net Pro Form Shortcode Attribute `cc="USD"` to one of these values: `cc="USD"`, or `cc="CAD"` or `cc="EUR"` or `cc="GBP"`. For further details, please see: `Dashboard -› Authorize.Net Pro Forms -› Shortcode Attributes (Explained)`.
* (s2Member Pro) **ClickBank Skins (#227)** Adding support for the `cbskin=""` Shortcode Attribute. For further details, please see: `Dashboard -› ClickBank Buttons -› Shortcode Attributes (Explained)`.
* (s2Member Pro) **ClickBank PitchPlus Upsell Flows (#227)** Adding support for ClickBank PitchPlus Upsell Flows via new Shortcode Attributes: `cbfid=""`, `cbur=""`, `cbf="auto"`. s2Member Pro now officially supports ClickBank PitchPlus Upsell Flows. We support PitchPlus Basic and PitchPlus Advanced too. For further details, please see: `Dashboard -› ClickBank Buttons -› Shortcode Attributes (Explained)`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Codestyling Localization** Adding automatic symlink creator for improved compatibility with the CodeStyling Localization plugin. A symlink is created automatically whenever the CodeStyling Localization plugin is installed, and s2Member® Pro is installed as well. The symlink allows the CodeStyling Localization plugin to scan files from the s2Member® Pro directory too; instead of only scanning the s2Member® Framework directory. s2Member and s2Member Pro are now both compatible with the Codestyling Localization plugin (optional).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Custom Templates w/ s2Stream Shortcode** Adding support for custom templates to be used in conjunction with the `s2Stream` Shortcode. It is now possible to take the default player templates from `/s2member/includes/templates/players/` and put these files inside your own WordPress® theme directory (or inside the `/wp-content/` directory). s2Member will automatically find your template files in these locations. Your custom template files will then be used instead of the built-in defaults.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix (#59)** Resending a password to a User from the Dashboard (while changing the User's email address at the same time); resulted in the email being sent to the previous email address instead of the new one. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix (#216)** Removing `-MultiViews` from s2Member's `.htaccess` file in the `/s2member-files/` directory. This improves compatibility with some Apache installations that simply have `AllowOverride All`; because `All` may not include `MultiViews` in some versions of Apache.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **IP Restrictions (#149)** In the Dashboard, we now report if a User is at (or above) max allowable IPs; instead of reporting only if they have actually triggered an internal security breach (which times out quickly in most cases). Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Enhancing JW Player Integration (#251)** Adding support for s2Stream Shortcode Attribute `player_aspectratio="12:5"` (as one example). See also [this post](http://www.longtailvideo.com/blog/32697/new-in-jw-player-responsive-design) at Longtail Video.
* (s2Member Pro) **Updating Payflow Integration (#193)** Removing DAILY `D` option for Payflow Recurring Billing. No longer supported by Payflow. However, s2Member will let a `D` value slip by Shortcode Attribute validation in case a site owner has arranged for this to become available against their Payflow account somehow; and to remain backward compatible with previous versions of s2Member Pro. Moving forward, it is NO longer possible to bill customers on a daily basis with PayPal Payments Pro (Payflow Edition). This is a PayPal limitation.
* (s2Member Pro) **Updating Payflow Integration w/ Payflow Bug Workaround (#193)** Updating Payflow integration to support Billing Agreement IDs (aka: `BAID` values) when working together with Payflow Express Checkout APIs (and where a site owner is charging on a recurring basis).

 This improvement also allows s2Member to work around a Payflow bug where `BILLINGTYPE=RecurringPayments` results in error `#7 (Invalid/Expired TOKEN)` whenever Payflow attempts to rebill a customer. s2Member now sets `BILLINGTYPE=RecurringBilling`; and we pass `BAID=B-xxxxxx` instead of passing `TOKEN=xxxxxx`.

 Site owners also need to [contact PayPal MTS](http://www.paypal.com/mts) and ask to have `Reference Transactions` (free) enabled for `Recurring Billing` service. ~ However, you ONLY need `Recurring Billing` service and `Reference Transactions` enabled IF you're operating a PayPal Payments Pro (Payflow Edition) account; and only IF you're charging customers on a recurring basis.

 All of these changes related to Payflow (as detailed in this changelog entry), impact only ONE specific scenario.
 - You have a PayPal Payments Pro (Payflow Edition) account.
 - You charge your customers on a recurring basis.
 - A customer chooses PayPal as their billing method during checkout.

 No other part of s2Member's integration with Payflow was modified in this release.

 For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/paypal-expired-security-token/page/2/) (or monitor the [s2Member KB](http://www.s2member.com/kb/) for new articles on this subject).
* (s2Member Pro) **Payflow API Docs**  Updating `s2m-pro-extras.zip` to include the latest versions of the PayPal Pro (Payflow Edition) APIs. s2Member Pro customers can download this optional ZIP file from their My Account page at s2Member.com. These are extras only, they are NOT part of the s2Member application.
* (s2Member Pro) **Google Checkout Bug Fix (#214)**  Updating s2Member's Google Checkout integration to properly support the `rrt` Shortcode Attribute. Fixed in this release. For further details please see [this thread](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/google-recurring-problem/#post-48218).
* (s2Member Pro) **Username Validation (#246)** Now forcing user input (during Pro Form registration) to lowercase on Multisite Networks to prevent unnecessary validation errors during checkout (saving a customer time). Also, s2Member now validates a customer's Username before it is passed through `sanitize_user()` (a core WordPress® function). This prevents confusion for a customer where certain characters were stripped out automatically, causing them problems when attempting to log in for the first time (e.g. the customer thinks their Username is `john~doe`; when it is actually `johndoe` because WordPress (when running a Multisite Network) removes anything that is NOT `a-z0-9 _.-@` (and s2Member removes whitespace as well).

= v130406 =

* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Multisite Networks (#145)** Bug fix on Multisite Networks related to User deletions and subsequent logins on child blogs. For further details, please see [this thread](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/deleted-users-can-log-in/#post-46738).
* (s2Member Pro) **New Feature (#59)** It is now possible to Edit a User in the Dashboard and check a box to have the User's password reset, and an email message sent automatically to the User/Member with a copy of the Username/Password. This requires s2Member® Pro.
* (s2Member Pro) **API Functions (#158)** New PayPal® Pro API Functions (`s2member_pro_paypal_rbp_for_user`, `s2member_pro_paypal_rbp_times_for_user`). These are for developers. For further details, please see [this article](http://www.s2member.com/codex/stable/s2member/api_functions/package-summary/) in the s2Member® Codex.
* (s2Member Pro) **API Functions (#158)** New PayPal® Pro (PayFlow® Edition) API Functions (`s2member_pro_payflow_rbp_for_user`, `s2member_pro_payflow_rbp_times_for_user`). These are for developers. For further details, please see [this article](http://www.s2member.com/codex/stable/s2member/api_functions/package-summary/) in the s2Member® Codex.

= v130404 =

* (s2Member Pro) **Compatibility (#108)** Updating s2Member® Pro's integration with Authorize.Net to allow charges up to `$99,999.00` (formerly `$10,000.00`).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **User Searches (#91)** Updating `pre_user_query` filter to include `first_name/last_name` (instead of only the `display_name`).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **bbPress Integration (#88)** Updating bbPress Role/Cap filter to exclude itself during bbPress deactivation. This was causing a loss of the `read` Capability inadvertently.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **PayPal® 20% Rule (#100)** Removing mention of the PayPal® 20% rule/limitation in the inline documentation. We confirmed with PayPal this ridiculous rule no longer applies to PayPal Standard Buttons.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **File Downloads (#73)** Fixed bug related to `%2F` in file download URLs leading to a `ccap` directory.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Debug Logging (#69)** Logging now disabled by default. New log recommendation/warning notices updated throughout all menu pages for s2Member®.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Debug Logging (#69)** Logging must now be disabled (and the logs directory must be non-existent or empty) for an s2Member® Security Badge to go green. There is only one way to bypass this security check. See KB Article: [s2Member® Security Badges](http://www.s2member.com/kb/security-badges/). Notices are displayed on activation of this version to warn site owners about this change.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **JW Player (#121)** Adding CSS `class` attribute to all JW Player template files used in conjunction with the `s2Stream` shortcode. New CSS class name: `s2member-jwplayer-v6`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **JW Player (#121)** Adding support for percentage-based width/height values in `player_width="" player_height=""` attributes of an s2Stream shortcode that generates a JW Player. Example: `player_width="100%"`.

= v130221 =

* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix (#41)** Custom Registration/Profile Fields with an ID that ended with `-[0-9]+` or `_[0-9]+` was failing JavaScript validation due to a parsing issue. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix (#43)** A bug first introduced in the last release of s2Member® v130220 was preventing Administrative New User Notifications from being sent by s2Member®. Fixed in this release.

= v130220 =

* (s2Member Pro) **Feature Enhancement/User Exportation (#33)** Adding support for UTF-8 BOM in CSV User export files. Now a configurable option during User/Member Exportation.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Feature Enhancement/Emails (#21)** Adding additional Replacement Codes for New User Email Notifications (for both the User/Member Notification and also for the Administrator Notification). The following Replacement Codes are now possible: `%%role%%`, `%%label%%`, `%%level%%`, `%%ccaps%%`. Also adding four new Filters for developers. These include: `ws_plugin__s2member_welcome_email_sbj`, `ws_plugin__s2member_welcome_email_msg`, `ws_plugin__s2member_admin_new_user_email_sbj`, `ws_plugin__s2member_admin_new_user_email_msg`. See `Dashboard -› General Options -›  Email Configuration` for further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Feature Enhancement/Emails (#30)** Adding support for PHP tags in the following emails: New User Notification, Administrative New User Notification, Signup Confirmation Email, Specific Post/Page Confirmation Email. See the relevant sections in your Dashboard for further details. Such as: `s2Member® -› General Options -› Email Configuration` and `s2Member® -› PayPal® Options -› Signup Confirmation Email`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Feature Enhancement/Shortcodes (#23)** Adding support for the `lang=""` Attribute in PayPal Buttons, PayPal Pro Forms, and in Google Checkout Buttons. This is a bit different from the existing `lc=""` value. The `lc=""` value controls the interface at PayPal, while the `lang=""` value controls the language of the Standard and/or Express Checkout Button itself (with respect to s2Member®). For further details, please see: `Dashboard -› PayPal Buttons (or Pro Forms) -› Shortcode Attributes (Explained)`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix** Fixing bug in User Access Package. Now checking if `$cap_enabled` also is `TRUE`; just in case another plugin or hack file attempts to disable Custom Capabilities without removing them. Not likely, but we can support this easily with a quick update in this release. Note... this has no impact on s2Member's existing functionality. Custom Capabilities continue to work just as they always have.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Feature Enhancement/Logging** Adding new logger. Logs to file `reg-handler.log`. Includes all User/Member registrations handled by s2Member® (either directly or indirectly). Only if logging is enabled. For further details, please check your Dashboard here: `s2Member® -› Log Files (Debug)`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Feature Enhancement/EOTs (#29)** Adding UI option for EOT Grace Time. For further details, please see: `Dashboard -› PayPal Options -› Automatic EOT Behavior`. Also adding a new Filter for developers: `ws_plugin__s2member_eot_grace_time`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Feature Enhancement/EOTs** Adding UI option for EOT Custom Capability Removal. For further details, please see: `Dashboard -› PayPal Options -› Automatic EOT Behavior`. Also adding a new Filter for developers: `ws_plugin__s2member_remove_ccaps_during_eot_events`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Feature Enhancement/s2Stream Shortcode (#32)** Adding additional support for JW Player™ Captions, Titles, Descriptions, and Media IDs (i.e. `player_title=""`, `player_description=""`, `player_mediaid=""`, `player_captions=""`). Please check the Shortcode Attributes tab in [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/jwplayer-s2stream-shortcodes/#using-s2stream-shortcodes) for further details.

= v130214 =

* **(Maintenance Release) Upgrade immediately.**
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Log Viewer (#16)** Additional log file descriptions have been added to the Dashboard, along with some other UI enhancements in this section.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix (#18)** Usernames consisting of all numeric values were not always being redirected to the Login Welcome Page upon logging in, even when s2Member® was configured to do so. Fixed in this release. Discussed in [this thread](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/subscribers-not-taken-to-welcome-page/page/2/#post-41663).
* (s2Member Pro) **Coupon Codes (#19)** Adding new Replacement Codes: `%%full_coupon_code%%`, `%%coupon_code%%` and `%%coupon_affiliate_id%%`. These are now available in all API Tracking Codes, in all Custom Return URLs for Pro Forms, and in most API Notifications.
* (s2Member Pro) **Coupon Codes (#19)** Deprecating the `%%affiliate_id%%` Replacement Code for tracking Affiliate Coupon Codes in favor of `%%coupon_affiliate_id%%`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Last Login Time** Improving readability of Last Login Time in list of Users/Members.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility** Improving support for WordPress® v3.6-alpha with respect to `tabindex` values on `/wp-login.php`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility** Bumping minimum WordPress® requirement from v3.2 up to v3.3. Starting with this release, s2Member® is no longer compatible with the much older WordPress® v3.2.

= v130213 =

* **(Maintenance Release) Upgrade immediately.**
* (s2Member Pro) **Compatibility (#13)** PayPal® Payments Pro, PayPal® Payments Pro (Payflow Edition), and Authorize.Net. s2Member® Pro now supports a recurring interval of Semi-Yearly (e.g. charges occur every six months). This has always been possible by manipulating Shortcode Attribues, but it's now officially supported by Pro Form Generators in your Dashboard — which come with s2Member® Pro.
* (s2Member Pro) **Compatibility (#13)** ClickBank® Recurring Products. ClickBank® has started allowing a Weekly recurring interval and stopped allowing Yearly. s2Member® has been updated in this release to support a Weekly recurring interval with ClickBank®; and to remove the Yearly option in the ClickBank® Button Generator.
* (s2Member Pro) **Compatibility (#13)** PayPal® Payments Pro (Payflow Edition). PayPal® Payments Pro (Payflow Edition) has started allowing a Daily recurring interval. s2Member® has been updated in this release to support a Daily recurring interval with PayPal® Payments Pro (Payflow Edition). Daily recurring intervals remain possible with PayPal® Pro accounts that do not include the additional Payflow API. This change simply adds official support for Daily recurring billing with PayPal® Payments Pro (Payflow Edition).
* (s2Member) **Debugging Assistance** Updating s2Member's PayPal® PDT/Auto-Return handler to better handle scenarios where a site owner is missing a PayPal® PDT Identity Token in their s2Member® configuration, or has incorrectly set the `custom=""` Shortcode Attribute in Payment Buttons generated with s2Member®. Administrative notices are now displayed in the Dashboard when/if this occurs and s2Member® can catch the issue during post-processing of a transaction.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **General Code Cleanup** Removing all `/**/` markers in the s2Member® codebase. These were used in conjunction with PolyStyle® code formatting tools to preserve line breaks in the code. The WebSharks™ development team no longer uses PolyStyle®, making these obsolete now. Removed in this release to improve readability for developers.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **General Code Cleanup** Removing all unnecessary uses of PHP's `eval()` function in s2Member's codebase. These were used to keep repetitive code all in a single line; part of a standard the WebSharks™ development team is now moving away from. Removed in this release to improve readability for developers; and to prevent unnecessary confusion.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Auto-EOT System** Updated s2Member's Auto-EOT System. s2Member® now leaves an additional note behind after a demotion, which references the Paid Subscr. Gateway and Paid Subscr. ID values before the demotion occurred. This way there is a better reference left behind after an automatic demotion occurs.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Searching Users** Updating search function in list of Users (i.e. `Dashboard -› Users -› [Search Box]`) to include the Administrative Notes field when searching for Users. This allows references to old Paid Subscr. IDs in the Administrative Notes field to be considered when searching Users/Members.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Last Login Time** Adding new User Option value (tracked by s2Member®). This option value tracks the last time each User/Member logged into your site. Ex: `get_user_option("s2member_last_login_time")`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Last Login Time** Adding new User data column to list of Users in the Dashboard: `Last Login Time`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Last Login Time** Adding new API Function: [`s2member_last_login_time()`](http://www.s2member.com/codex/stable/s2member/api_functions/package-summary/).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **ezPHP** Updated all internal documentation references that pointed to Exec-PHP or the PHP Execution plugin as recommendations for developers that wish to integrate PHP tags into Posts/Pages/Widgets. These old references now point to the [ezPHP](http://www.s2member.com/kb/ezphp-plugin/) plugin by s2Member® Lead Developer: Jason Caldwell. s2Member® remains compatible with other PHP plugins, but we recommend [ezPHP](http://www.s2member.com/kb/ezphp-plugin/) for the best compatibility with both s2Member® and WordPress® itself.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Simple Shortcode Conditionals** Adding a [Simple Shortcode Conditionals](http://www.s2member.com/kb/simple-shortcode-conditionals/) section to `s2Member® -› Restriction Options` in the Dashboard. This way more site owners will be aware of this feature from the start.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Login/Registration Design** Login/Registration Design with s2Member® is now optional (e.g. this feature can be disabled now — if you prefer). See: `Dashboard -› s2Member® -› General Options -› Login/Registration Design`. This feature is enabled by default on all s2Member® installations.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Inline Documentation** Adding more links to KB articles throughout the Dashboard area.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Inline Documentation** Updating all spaced parenthesis like `( something... )` to remove the grammatical errors — by removing the extra spaces inside these brackets.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Inline Documentation** Removing all references to PriMoThemes and/or primothemes.com within the application itself. PriMoThemes is now s2Member® (as of Jan 2012 — it's been awhile; so time to remove these obviously).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Inline Documentation** Adding link to "more updates..." in the Dashboard, pointing to the s2Member® KB. Increasing number of recent KB udpates from 3 up to 5. These are visible from any s2Member® page in the Dashboard (top of the right-hand column).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Inline Documentation** Adding [s2Member® Pro](http://www.s2member.com/pro/) (a recommended upgrade) to the Quick-Start Guide for s2Member® — in the Dashboard.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Inline Documentation** Adding Troubleshooting section to the Quick-Start Guide for s2Member® — in the Dashboard.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Inline Documentation** Adding Perfect Theme section to the Quick-Start Guide for s2Member® — in the Dashboard.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Inline Documentation** Adding video tutorial to the `Dashboard -› s2Member® -› API / Scripting -› Custom Capabilities` section.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Logging Functionality** Adding an s2Member® Log Viewer to the Dashboard for all site owners; and also for s2Member® Support Reps to use when running diagnostics. See: `Dashboard -› s2Member® -› Log Files (Debug)` for further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Logging Functionality** Logging routines are now enabled by default on all new installations of s2Member®. Existing installations of s2Member® are advised to enable logging, by visiting this section of your Dashboard. See: `s2Member® -› PayPal® Options (or Authorize.Net, ClickBank, etc) -› Account Details -› Logging`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Logging Functionality** Additional logging routines that will track all s2Member® HTTP communication within WordPress® is now enabled by default. This new log file will be located inside `/wp-content/plugins/s2member-logs`. It is named: `s2-http-api-debug.log`. See: `Dashboard -› s2Member® -› Log Files (Debug)` for further details.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Logging Functionality** Additional logging routines that will track *all* HTTP communication within WordPress® are now possible (these are quite extensive). See: `Dashboard -› s2Member® -› Log Files (Debug) -› Logging Configuration` for further details. This more extensive logging is disabled by default; it must be enabled by a site owner. For debugging only — this should NEVER be enabled on a live site.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Logging Functionality** Adding date/time to all log entries maintained by s2Member®.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **GZIP Conflicts** Adding additional lines of defense against GZIP conflicts during file downloads, with calls to `@apache_setenv("no-gzip", "1")` in other areas — not just during public file downloads (e.g. also during User/Member exporations, log file downloads, etc).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **GZIP Conflicts** Adding an additional line of defense against GZIP conflicts during file downloads, with this line now appearing in the `.htaccess` file snippet added by the s2Member® software application: `RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} (^|\?|&)no-gzip\=1`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **GZIP Conflicts** Adding an additional line of defense against GZIP conflicts during User/Member exporations, log file downloads, and other downloads that come straight from the Dashboard area to site owners via web browsers. s2Member® now sends `Content-Encoding: none` to prevent Apache's `mod_deflate` from interfering with s2Member® under these special scenarios. A `Content-Encoding: none` header value is technically invalid, but it's known to prevent issues with `mod_deflate`. Since a `Content-Encoding: none` header value is technically invalid, s2Member® does NOT implement this during public file downloads; where we need to provide wider support for a long list of devices that may choke on this incorrect value. This is only implemented for site owners in the administrative areas of WordPress; and only for file downloads related to CSV export files and logs.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix** Fixed incorrect `preg_split` limit against `$paypal['item_number']` in IPN handler for `subscr_payment` and `subscr_cancel` transaction types. Doesn't appear to have affected anything negatively, but it was wrong none the less. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix** Fixed incorrect handling of a single opt-in checkbox on BuddyPress registration forms, which was not being wrapped with s2Member's BuddyPress container divs at all times. A symptom of this bug was to see a checkbox on your BuddyPress registration that was out of alignment or out of position. Fixed in this release.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility** Updated all of s2Member's IPN handlers to accept `$_REQUEST` data for Proxy-related variables like `s2member_paypal_proxy_return_url`. This allows s2Member® itself to use `$_POST` variables for Proxy-related variables; and it further reduces the likelihood of 403 Forbidden errors caused by [paranoid Mod Security configurations](http://www.s2member.com/kb/mod-security-random-503-403-errors/). One issue this should help to correct, is a mysterious case where a `success=""` Shortcode Attribute is not working as you might expect. This can be caused by [paranoid Mod Security configurations](http://www.s2member.com/kb/mod-security-random-503-403-errors/) at places like HostGator®, because a URL is passing through a query string. This release will help to prevent this from becoming a problem, because `success=""` URLs will be passed through `$_POST` variables now in all Pro Form integrations.

= v130207 =

* **(Maintenance Release) Upgrade immediately.**
* (s2Member Pro) **Bug Fix (#2)** Modification Tracking Codes not working properly under s2Member's Authorize.Net integration. Fixed in this release. Discussed in [this thread](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/shareasale-integration-not-working/#post-40954).
* (s2Member) **Compatibility (#4)** PayPal® integrated into a site charging in the JPY currency was incorrectly limited to an amount of 10000.00. Fixed in this release. Discussed in [this thread](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/default-currency-can-i-change-it-to-yen/#post-40590).
* (s2Member) **Compatibility (#5)** Incorrect `tabindex` values in WordPress® v3.5+. Fixed in this release. Discussed in [this thread](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/tabindex-messed-up-on-registration-page/#post-40591).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Line Breaks (#3)** Some line breaks in both s2Member® and s2Member® Pro were converted to CRLF inadvertently in the previous release. No real harm done, but this was causing some problems for the s2Member® Server Scanner because it uses a checksum against installation files; which was being thrown off balance due to the unexpected line break style. Fixed in this release. A symptom of this bug was to see invalid checksums when running diagnostics with the s2Member® Server Scanner.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **Compatibility (#6)** s2Member® File Downloads (audio/video files) with spaces in a file name were not always being handled properly. Fixed in this release. Discussed in [this thread](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/jwplayer-filename-bug/#post-40799).

= v130203 =

* **(New Release) Please read this changelog for important details.**
* (s2Member Pro) **Remote Ops API (`create_user`)** s2Member® Pro's Remote Operations API, for the `create_user` Operation has been updated to support a new specification: `modify_if_login_exists`. For further details, please check your s2Member® Pro Dashboard here: `s2Member® -› API / Scripting -› Remote Operations API`.
* (s2Member Pro) **Remote Ops API (`modify_user`,`delete_user`)** s2Member® Pro's Remote Operations API has been updated to support two additional Operations: `update_user` and `delete_user`. For further details on these new Operations, please check your s2Member® Pro Dashboard here: `s2Member® -› API / Scripting -› Remote Operations API`.
* (s2Member Pro) **Remote Ops API (`init` hook priority)** s2Member® Pro's Remote Operations API has been updated to prevent conflicts when running in concert with BuddyPress v1.6.4+. Hook priority now running at default value of `11`, right after BuddyPress v1.6.4 at hook priority `10`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **s2Stream Shortcode (#88)** s2Member® now supports JW Player® license keys (for the professional edition) using Shortcode Attribute `player_key=""` (or they can be specified sitewide via JavaScript provided by Longtail Video — optional). See [this discussion](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/jwplayer-shortcode-for-poster-not-working/#post-40435). See also: [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/jwplayer-s2stream-shortcodes/#using-s2stream-shortcodes).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **s2Stream Shortcode (#88)** Bug fix. The s2Stream Shortcode was not working properly (with respect to a specific Shortcode Attribute: `player_image=""`). Fixed in this release. See [this discussion](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/jwplayer-shortcode-for-poster-not-working/#post-40128). See also: [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/jwplayer-s2stream-shortcodes/#using-s2stream-shortcodes).
* (s2Member Pro) **User Exportation (#89)** s2Member® Pro's User Exportation now includes separate data columns for each Custom Registration/Profile Field that you've configured with s2Member®. Also, s2Member® Pro will now include ALL Custom Registration/Profile Fields (even if there is no value associated with certain Fields, for specific Users/Members — e.g. empty column values will now be included by s2Member® Pro). This provides a more consistent/readable CSV export file; a major improvement. Discussed in [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/importing-updating-users/#custom-registration-profile-fields).
* (s2Member Pro) **User Importation (#89)** s2Member® Pro's User/Member Import format changed in this release (with respect to Custom Registration/Profile Fields only). If you are importing Custom Registration/Profile Fields, please review [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/importing-updating-users/#custom-registration-profile-fields) before you import new Users/Members or mass update any existing Users/Members. ALSO NOTE: User/Member CSV Export Files generated by previous versions of s2Member® Pro (if they contained any Custom Registration/Profile Fields) will NOT be compatible with this latest release (e.g. you should NOT attempt to re-import those old files in an effort to mass update existing Users/Members). Please generate a new User/Member CSV Export File in the latest release of s2Member® Pro before attempting to edit and/or mass update existing Users/Members with applications like MS Excel or OpenOffice.

= v130123 =

* **(Maintenance Release) Upgrade immediately.**
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **s2Stream Shortcode (#78)** s2Member® now supports JW Player® license keys using Shortcode Attribute `player_key=""`. See [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/jwplayer-s2stream-shortcodes/) please. Also discussed in [this thread](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/new-jw-player-6-s2-video-audio-shortcodes/#post-38768).
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **s2Stream Shortcode (#79)** s2Member® now supports JW Player® [Advanced Option Blocks](http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/jw-player/28839/embedding-the-player) using Shortcode Attribute `player_option_blocks=""`. Example: `player_option_blocks="sharing:{}"`. See [this KB article](http://www.s2member.com/kb/jwplayer-s2stream-shortcodes/) please. Also discussed in [this thread](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/new-jw-player-6-s2-video-audio-shortcodes/#post-38768).
* (s2Member Pro) **User Exportation (#80)** s2Member® Pro User Exportation now occurs with MySQL `ORDER BY ID`, instead of no `ORDER BY` at all. This helps to prevent confusion and buggy behavior. Discussed in [this thread](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/user-export-not-working-properly/#post-39123).
* (s2Member Pro) **User Exportation (#81)** s2Member Pro's User Exportation now supports the exporation of up to `1000` User/Member table rows at once. Of course it remains possible to export ALL of your Users/Members with s2Member® Pro. All we've done here is bump the default limit from `250` up to `1000` at a time. In addition, there is a new Filter making it possible to extend this limit further on servers that can handle it. Use Filter: `ws_plugin__s2member_pro_export_users_limit` if you would like to export more Users all at once. See also: `Dashboard -› s2Member® Pro -› User/Member Exportation`.
* (s2Member/s2Member Pro) **KB Articles** Inline documentation updated in some areas, with a few links pointing to helpful/related KB articles.

= v130121 =

* **(Maintenance Release) Upgrade immediately.**
* **New Feature** s2Member® now comes with a new Shortcode `[s2Stream file_download="video.mp4" player="jwplayer-v6" ... /]`, making it MUCH easier for site owners to implemement RTMP streams of audio/video content. For further details, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member® -› Download Options -› JW Player® v6 and RTMP Protocol Examples`. See also: `s2Member® -› Download Options -› Shortcode Attributes (Explained)`.
* **Compatibility (#75)** Updated s2Member's local file storage engine (for File Downloads via s2Member®), to support special characters in file names. Discussed in [this thread](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/problem-with-quotes-in-filename-downloads/#post-38395).
* **Bug Fix (#71)** A bug first introduced in the previous release of v130116, where we added support for byte-range requests to s2Member's File Download functionality, was causing multiple byte-range requests (processed by s2Member) to count against each User/Member as multiple File Downloads. Fixed in this release.
* **Compatibility** Updated s2Member's integration with Amazon® S3 to extend the default 30 second connection timeout (which was too conservative for many integrations) up to 24 hours by default, making it match the same as s2Member's Amazon® CloudFront connection timeout. For further details, please check your Dashboard under: `s2Member® -› Download Options -› Amazon® S3/CDN Storage -› Dev Note w/Technical Details`. It is possible to modify this connection timeout through a Filter discussed there.

= v130116 =

* **(Maintenance Release) Upgrade immediately.**
* **Compatibility (#39)** Updated codes samples for JW Player®, to include the `mp4:` prefix when implementing RTMP streams against MP4 video files. Discussed in [this thread](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/cloudfront-subfolder-streaming-error/#post-35750).
* **Compatibility (#51)** Updated Payflow® API to support recurring billing every six months. Discussed in [this thread](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/payflow-error-6-month-recurring-membership/#post-36053).
* **Bug Fix (#69)** Updated multisite user imporation routine, to support a specific scenario not covered under WordPress v3.5. Discussed in [this thread](http://www.s2member.com/forums/topic/users-on-multisite/).
* **Feature Improvement (#71)** s2Member® has been updated to support byte-range requests with it's default local file storage engine, served from the `/s2member-files/` directory. s2Member® has always supported byte-range requests when integrated with Amazon® CloudFront.
